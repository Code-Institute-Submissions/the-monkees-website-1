                <h1>ABOUT THE BAND</h1>
                <div class="about-section">
                    <p>The Monkees are an American rock and pop band originally active between 1965 and 1971, with subsequent reunion albums and tours in the decades that followed. They were formed in Los Angeles in 1965 by Bob Rafelson and Bert Schneider
                        for the American television series The Monkees, which aired from 1966 to 1968. The musical acting quartet was composed of Americans Micky Dolenz, Michael Nesmith and Peter Tork and British stage and television actor and singer
                        Davy Jones. The band's music was initially supervised by producer Don Kirshner, backed by the songwriting duo of Tommy Boyce and Bobby Hart.<br><br> For the first few months of their initial five-year career as "the Monkees", the four
                        actor-musicians were allowed only limited roles in the recording studio. This was due in part to the amount of time required to film the television series. Nonetheless, Nesmith did compose and produce some songs from the beginning,
                        and Peter Tork contributed limited guitar work on the sessions produced by Nesmith. They eventually fought for and earned the right to collectively supervise all musical output under the band's name. The sitcom was canceled in
                        1968, but the band continued to record music through 1971.<br><br> A revival of interest in the television show came in 1986, which led to a series of reunion tours and new records. Until 2011, the group had reunited and toured several
                        times, with varying degrees of success. Despite the sudden death of Davy Jones on February 29, 2012, the surviving members reunited for a tour in Novemberâ€“December 2012 and again in 2013 for a 24-date tour. As of December 2016,
                        they continue to tour, with Dolenz and Tork providing the core of the band, assisted by several other professional musicians, for their 50th anniversary tour through the US, Australia, and New Zealand in 2016. Nesmith was able
                        to free some time up to join them in the latter stages of the US tour.</p>

                                    <h4>Davy Jones</h4>
                                    <p>From 1966 to 1971, Jones was a member of the Monkees, a pop-rock group formed expressly for a television show of the same name.
                                    With Screen Gems producing the series, Jones was shortlisted for auditions, as he was the only Monkee who was signed to a deal with the studio,
                                    but still had to meet producers Bob Rafelson's and Bert Schneider's standards. Jones sang lead vocals on many of the Monkees' recordings,
                                    including "I Wanna Be Free" and "Daydream Believer". The DVD release of the first season of the show contained commentary from the various bandmates.
                                    In Peter Tork's commentary, he stated that Jones was a good drummer and had the live performance lineups been based solely on playing ability,
                                    it should have been Tork on guitar, Mike Nesmith on bass, and Jones on drums, with Micky Dolenz taking the fronting role,
                                    rather than as it was done (with Nesmith on guitar, Tork on bass, and Dolenz on drums). Mostly playing tambourine or maracas,
                                    Jones filled in briefly for Tork on bass when he played keyboards.</p>
