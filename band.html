                <h1>ABOUT THE BAND</h1>
                <div class="about-section">
                    <p>The Monkees are an American rock and pop band originally active between 1965 and 1971, with subsequent reunion albums and tours in the decades that followed. They were formed in Los Angeles in 1965 by Bob Rafelson and Bert Schneider
                        for the American television series The Monkees, which aired from 1966 to 1968. The musical acting quartet was composed of Americans Micky Dolenz, Michael Nesmith and Peter Tork and British stage and television actor and singer
                        Davy Jones. The band's music was initially supervised by producer Don Kirshner, backed by the songwriting duo of Tommy Boyce and Bobby Hart.<br><br> For the first few months of their initial five-year career as "the Monkees", the
                        four actor-musicians were allowed only limited roles in the recording studio. This was due in part to the amount of time required to film the television series. Nonetheless, Nesmith did compose and produce some songs from the beginning,
                        and Peter Tork contributed limited guitar work on the sessions produced by Nesmith. They eventually fought for and earned the right to collectively supervise all musical output under the band's name. The sitcom was canceled in
                        1968, but the band continued to record music through 1971.<br><br> A revival of interest in the television show came in 1986, which led to a series of reunion tours and new records. Until 2011, the group had reunited and toured
                        several times, with varying degrees of success. Despite the sudden death of Davy Jones on February 29, 2012, the surviving members reunited for a tour in Novemberâ€“December 2012 and again in 2013 for a 24-date tour. As of December
                        2016, they continue to tour, with Dolenz and Tork providing the core of the band, assisted by several other professional musicians, for their 50th anniversary tour through the US, Australia, and New Zealand in 2016. Nesmith was
                        able to free some time up to join them in the latter stages of the US tour.</p>

                                    <p>From 1966 to 1971, Jones was a member of the Monkees, a pop-rock group formed expressly for a television show of the same name. With Screen Gems producing the series, Jones was shortlisted for auditions, as he was the
                                        only Monkee who was signed to a deal with the studio, but still had to meet producers Bob Rafelson's and Bert Schneider's standards. Jones sang lead vocals on many of the Monkees' recordings, including "I Wanna
                                        Be Free" and "Daydream Believer". The DVD release of the first season of the show contained commentary from the various bandmates. In Peter Tork's commentary, he stated that Jones was a good drummer and had the
                                        live performance lineups been based solely on playing ability, it should have been Tork on guitar, Mike Nesmith on bass, and Jones on drums, with Micky Dolenz taking the fronting role, rather than as it was done
                                        (with Nesmith on guitar, Tork on bass, and Dolenz on drums). Mostly playing tambourine or maracas, Jones filled in briefly for Tork on bass when he played keyboards.</p>

                                    <h4>Micky Dolenz</h4>
                                    <p>In 1965, Dolenz was cast in the television sitcom The Monkees and became the drummer and a lead vocalist in the band created for the show. He was not actually a drummer
                                    and needed lessons even to be able to mime credibly, but eventually was taught how to play properly. By the time The Monkees went on tour in late 1966, Dolenz was
                                    competent enough to play the drums himself. He learned to play right-handed and left-footed because of a leg disease called Perthes making his right leg weak.<br><br>
                                    Tommy Boyce and Bobby Hart, writers of many of The Monkees' songs, observed quickly that when brought into the studio together, the four actors would try to make
                                    each other laugh. Because of this, the writers often brought in each singer individually. The antics escalated until one time Dolenz poured a cup of Coca-Cola on
                                    Don Kirshner's head; at the time, Dolenz did not know Kirshner on sight.<br><br>
                                    According to Mike Nesmith, Dolenz's voice made The Monkees' sound distinctive, and during tension-filled times, Nesmith and Peter Tork voluntarily turned over
                                    lead vocal duties to Dolenz on their own compositions.<br><br>
                                    Dolenz wrote a few of the band's self-penned songs, most prominent being "Randy Scouse Git" from the album Headquarters. He provided the lead vocals for such hits
                                    as "Last Train to Clarksville", "Take a Giant Step", and "I'm a Believer". Toward the end of the series' two-year run, Dolenz directed and co-wrote the show's final episode.<br><br>
                                    Dolenz purchased the third 25 Moog synthesizer commercially sold. (The first two belonged to Wendy Carlos and Buck Owens.) His performance on The Monkees song "Daily Nightly"
                                    (written by Nesmith) from the LP Pisces, Aquarius, Capricorn & Jones Ltd. was one of the first uses of the synthesizer on a rock recording. He eventually sold his instrument to Bobby Sherman.
                                    He is the only member of The Monkees who has been with the band continuously since its inception.</p>

                                    <h4>Michael Nesmith</h4>
                                    <p>From 1965 to early 1970, Nesmith was a member of the television pop-rock band The Monkees, created for the television situation comedy of the same name.
                                    According to his May 2015 interview on Gilbert Gottfried's podcast, someone showed him a copy of the famous press advertisement asking for "four insane boys" so
                                    he applied for the job. Nesmith won his role largely by appearing blasÃ© when he auditioned. He wore a wool hat to keep his hair out of his eyes, riding his motorcycle
                                    to the audition. Producers Bob Rafelson and Bert Schneider remembered "Wool Hat", and called Nesmith back.<br><br>
                                    Once he was cast, Screen Gems bought his songs so they could be used in the show. Many of the songs Nesmith wrote for The Monkees, such as
                                    "The Girl I Knew Somewhere", "Mary, Mary" and "Listen to the Band", became minor hits. One song he wrote, "You Just May Be the One", is in mixed meter,
                                    interspersing 5/4 bars into an otherwise 4/4 structure.<br><br>
                                    The Gretsch guitar company built a one-off natural finish 12-string electric guitar for Nesmith when he was performing with The Monkees
                                    (Gretsch had a promotional deal with the group).[11] He earlier played a customized Gretsch twelve-string, which had originally been a six-string model.
                                    Nesmith used this guitar for his appearances on the television series, as well as The Monkees' live appearances in 1966 and 1967. Beginning in 1968,
                                    Nesmith used a white six-string Gibson SG Custom for his live appearances with The Monkees.
                                    He would use that guitar in their motion picture Head for the live version of "Circle Sky", and also for the final original Monkees tour in 1969 with
                                    Davy Jones and Micky Dolenz. In a post on his Facebook page in 2011, Nesmith reported that both guitars were stolen in the early 1970s.<br><br>
                                    As with the other Monkees, Nesmith came to be frustrated by the manufactured image of the whole project. He was permitted to write and produce two songs per album,
                                    and his music was frequently featured in episodes of the series. Nesmith was the most publicly vocal Monkee about the band's prefabricated image.</p>

                                    <h4>Peter Tork</h4>
                                    <p>Stephen Stills had auditioned for the new television series about four pop-rock musicians but was turned down because the show's producers felt his hair
                                    and teeth would not photograph well on camera.[10] They asked Stills if he knew of someone with a similar "open, Nordic look," and Stills suggested Tork audition
                                    for the part.[11] Tork got the job and became one of the four members of the Monkees, a fictitious pop band in the mid-1960s, created for a television sitcom written
                                    about the fictitious band. Tork was the oldest member of the group.<br><br>
                                    Tork was a proficient musician, and though the group was not allowed to play their own instruments on their first two albums, he was an exception,
                                    playing what he described as "third chair guitar" on Mike Nesmith's song, "Papa Gene's Blues," from their first album. He subsequently played keyboards,
                                    bass guitar, banjo, harpsichord, and other instruments on their recordings. He also co-wrote, along with Joey Richards, the closing theme song of the
                                    second season of The Monkees, "For Pete's Sake". On the television show, he was relegated to playing the "lovable dummy," a persona Tork had developed as a folk singer
                                    in New York's Greenwich Village.[12] The DVD release of the first season of the show contained commentary from the various bandmates. In it, Nesmith stated that
                                    Tork was better at playing guitar than bass. In Tork's commentary, he stated that Jones was a good drummer and had the live performance lineups been based solely
                                    on playing ability, it should have been Tork on guitar, Nesmith on bass, and Jones on drums, with Dolenz taking the fronting role, rather than as it was done
                                    (with Nesmith on guitar, Tork on bass, and Dolenz on drums). Jones filled in briefly for Tork on bass when he played keyboards.<br><br>
                                    Recording and producing as a group was Tork's major interest, and he hoped that the four members would continue working together as a band on future recordings.
                                    However, the four did not have enough in common regarding their musical interests. In commentary for the DVD release of the second season of the show,
                                    Tork said that Dolenz was "incapable of repeating a triumph". Dolenz felt that once he had accomplished something and became a success at it,
                                    there was no artistic sense in repeating a formula.<br><br>
                                    Tork, once free from Don Kirshner's restrictions, in 1967, contributed some of the most memorable and catchy instrumental flourishes, such as the piano introduction
                                    to "Daydream Believer" and the banjo part on "You Told Me", as well as exploring occasional songwriting with the likes of "For Pete's Sake" and "Lady's Baby".<br><br>
                                    Tork was close to his grandmother, staying with her sometimes in his Greenwich Village days, and after he became a Monkee. "Grams" was one of his most ardent supporters
                                    and managed his fan club, often writing personal letters to members, and visiting music stores to make sure they carried Monkees records.<br><br>
                                    Six albums were produced with the original Monkees lineup, four of which went to No. 1 on the Billboard chart. This success was supplemented by two years of the
                                    TV show, a series of successful concert tours both across America and abroad, and a trippy-psychedelic movie, Head, a bit ahead of its time.[citation needed] However,
                                    tensions, both musical and personal, were increasing within the group. The band finished a Far East tour in December 1968 (where his copy of Naked Lunch was confiscated
                                    by Australian Customs[13]) and then filmed an NBC television special, 33â…“ Revolutions Per Monkee, which rehashed many of the ideas from Head, only with the Monkees
                                    playing a strangely[citation needed] second-string role.<br><br>
                                    No longer getting the group dynamic he wanted, and pleading "exhaustion" from the grueling schedule, Tork bought out the remaining four years of his contract after
                                    filming was complete on December 20, 1968, at a default of $150,000/year.[citation needed] In the DVD commentary for the 33â…“ Revolutions Per Monkee TV specialâ€”originally
                                    broadcast April 14, 1969 â€“ Dolenz noted that Nesmith gave Tork a gold watch as a going-away present, engraved "From the guys down at work". Tork kept the back,
                                    but replaced the watch several times in later years.</p>
