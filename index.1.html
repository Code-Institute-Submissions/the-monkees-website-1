                        <h4>Tickets Now Avail: Michael Nesmith & The First National Band Return To The Stage</h4>
                        <input type="checkbox" id="news-toggle-4">
                        <p>Almost fifty years ago, in May 1968, Michael Nesmith ventured to Nashville to record a series of groundbreaking sessions with local musicians.
                        What they produced is now recognized as the foundation of the country-rock and alt-country movements.<br><br>
                        “I could just feel this happening, that there was this ‘thing,’” recalled Nez.
                        “So, I headed off to Nashville to see if I couldn’t get some of the Nashville country thing into the rock’n’roll or vice versa.” Nez’s intuition was correct;
                        he was on the leading edge of a new genre. His exploratory work caught the attention of legendary RCA A&R man Felton Jarvis who had produced the Nashville sessions with Nez.
                        In February 1970, Jarvis signed Nez and his new band, the First National Band (pedal steel virtuoso Red Rhodes, bassist John London, and drummer John Ware),
                        to a deal with the venerable imprint and produced their first record, Magnetic South.< Despite the eight innovative country-rock LP’s Nesmith created between 1970 and 1978,
                        he is one of the less heralded architects of the genre. The First National Band’s three classic albums -- Magnetic South, Loose Salute,
                        and Nevada Fighter -- spawned four charting singles, including “Joanne” which reached #21 on the Billboard Top 100. However,
                        live success for the fledgling band was harder to come by and the musicians Nez collected to bring his country-rock dream to market soon scattered.
                        Nez played out his remaining RCA albums with Red Rhodes and toured with him throughout the ‘70s.
                        Yet the full-blown sounds of the First National Band were never to be heard on the concert stage again.
                        In January 2018, Michael Nesmith will bring this music back to the live arena with a series of shows focused on his RCA recordings,
                        including a show on January 25th at the Troubadour in Los Angeles, where he debuted the First National Band in March 1970. Songs like “Different Drum”
                        (a Top 20 hit for Linda Ronstadt & The Stone Poneys), “Listen to the Band”, “Some of Shelly’s Blues” (covered by the Nitty Gritty Dirt Band),
                        and “Silver Moon” will join lesser-known but equally transcendent album sides in a rebirth of what was labeled by critics as “the greatest music that you never heard.”

                        <input type="checkbox" id="news-toggle-5">
                        <p>Who's ready for even more of MORE? In honor of 50th anniversary this year, we've super-sized MORE OF THE MONKEES with a staggering 91 tracks including 55 previously-unreleased
                        alternate takes, remixes, and newly discovered concert recordings from 1967, the band's earliest-known live tracks, as well as a bonus 7” of “I’m A Believer” (Remix)/”(I’m Not Your)
                        Steppin’ Stone” (Vocals Only).<br><br>
                        "This is the most exciting archival dig through The Monkees' vault since 2009's THE BIRDS, THE BEES AND THE MONKEES DELUXE EDITION.
                        Every track is newly mastered for this set; the live material is the most historically significant of their career," says Andrew Sandoval,
                        who produced the set and wrote a new essay for its expansive booklet.<br><br>
                        MORE OF THE MONKEES: SUPER DELUXE EDITION significantly expands the special edition of MORE OF THE MONKEES released in 2006. Along with mono and stereo mixes of the original album,
                        the SUPER DELUXE EDITION takes listeners into the studio for the making of the album through extensive studio outtakes. Many make their debut here,
                        including the first recorded versions of: "Words," "Valleri," "Hold On Girl" and more. Backing tracks for early version of "Sometime In The Morning,"
                        "I'm A Believer" and "Look Out (Here Comes Tomorrow)" offer a behind-the-scenes perspective on the creative process.<br><br>
                        However, the set's most historic aspect is the inclusion of newly discovered unreleased live music. Recorded in Arizona in 1967,
                        these 10 tracks are The Monkees' earliest-known live recordings. The performance highlights songs from the band's 1966 self-titled debut ("I Wanna Be Free" and "Papa Gene's Blues"),
                        along with covers of Ray Charles' "I Got A Woman" and Willie Dixon's "You Can't Judge A Book By The Cover."<br><br>
                        Limited to just 4,500 numbered copies and housed in a hardbound 7"x7" box, the collection is available exclusively from monkees.com and rhino.com.
                        MORE OF THE MONKEES: SUPER DELUXE EDITION will be available on December 22, but you can pre-order now.</p>

                        <h4>MICHAEL NESMITH'S MUSICAL CAREER HIGHLIGHTED ON INFINITE TUESDAY: AUTOBIOGRAPHICAL RIFFS</h4>
                        <input type="checkbox" id="news-toggle-8">
                        <p>Rhino Serves Up The Audio Companion To Nesmith's Autobiography With 14 Of His Best Songs With The Monkees, The First National Band, And Solo
                        CD And Digital Versions Available On April 14<br><br>
                        Michael Nesmith tells the story of his eclectic life in his upcoming book, Infinite Tuesday: An Autobiographical Riff (Crown Archetype).
                        In it, the artist retraces his journey from his childhood in Dallas - where his single mother Bette invented Liquid Paper - to the set of "The Monkees" in Los Angeles,
                        as well as his pioneering work in music video and virtual reality.<br><br>
                        Before the book arrives on April 18, Rhino will release an audio companion that showcases 14 of Nez's best from his days with The Monkees, The First National Band, and solo.
                        INFINITE TUESDAY: AUTOBIOGRAPHICAL RIFFS will be available April 14 on CD and digitally.<br><br>
                        The set flows in mostly chronological order, beginning in 1965 when Nesmith recorded "The New Recruit" using the pseudonym Michael Blessing.
                        Monkee-mania took over a year later and he spent the next four years making history and music with the quartet. Two songs by the Monkees included here neatly bookend Nesmith's tenure 
                        in the group, with "Papa Gene's Blues" from the band's 1966 self-titled debut, and "Listen To The Band" from The Monkees Present (1970), Nesmith's last album with group for more than
                        20 years.<br><br>
                        The collection focuses mainly on the numerous solo albums that Nesmith recorded during the Seventies. He started in 1970 with Magnetic South and Loose Salute, country-rock albums that
                        featured Nesmith and The First National Band, a group he collaborated with for several years. INFINITE TUESDAY features a song from each album: "Silver Moon" from Loose Salute and
                        "Joanne" from Magnetic South, Nesmith's first Top 40 hit as a solo artist.<br><br>
                        Nesmith embraced a multimedia approach to making music in 1975 to create The Prison, an album that was to be played as the "soundtrack" to a novella that came with the music.
                        Represented on this set by "Opening Theme - Life, The Unsuspecting Captive," that album was also the first released on Nesmith's record label, Pacific Arts.<br><br>
                        Then in 1979 Nesmith created "PopClips," the first-ever music-video program, which aired years before the dawn of MTV. That same year, Nesmith also recorded Infinite Rider On
                        The Big Dogma, which featured "Cruisin'" and "Light," which also appear on this set. Nesmith made videos for those songs and others and released them in 1981 as Elephant Parts.
                        A mix of comedy sketches and music videos, this "video album" won the very first Grammy Award for Music Video.<br><br>
                        INFINITE TUESDAY ends with a pair of tracks from albums released after Nesmith returned from an extended recording hiatus: "Laugh Kills Lonesome" from ...Tropical Campfires... (1992),
                        and "Rays," the title song from his 2005 album.</p>
